# Purpose:

The `infrastructure/` folder (which may not be present in all projects, especially simpler ones) is dedicated to Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC). It holds configuration files and scripts that define and automate the provisioning and management of the project's infrastructure (cloud resources, servers, networks, etc.).

If terraform isn't used, at minimum, a diagram documenting the architecture should be included.

# Typical Contents:
*   **Terraform configurations (`.tf` files)**:  If using Terraform for IaC, this folder will contain Terraform files that describe the desired infrastructure state.
*   **CloudFormation templates (`.yaml` or `.json` files)**: If using AWS CloudFormation, this folder will contain CloudFormation templates for infrastructure definition.
*   **Ansible playbooks (`.yaml` files)**: If using Ansible for configuration management, this folder might contain Ansible playbooks to configure servers and deploy applications.
*   **Deployment scripts (e.g., shell scripts, Python scripts)**: Scripts for deploying the application to the provisioned infrastructure.
*   **Environment configuration files**: Files that store configuration variables specific to different environments (development, staging, production).

# Usage Guidelines:

*   Utilize IaC tools to automate infrastructure provisioning and management.
*   Keep infrastructure configurations version-controlled.
*   Document the infrastructure setup, deployment process, and any necessary environment-specific details.
*   Consider using environment variables or configuration management tools to handle environment-specific settings.
