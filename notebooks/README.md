# Purpose:

The `notebooks/` folder is designed for exploratory data analysis (EDA), prototyping, experimentation, and interactive development using Jupyter Notebooks. Notebooks are excellent for iterative analysis, visualization, and documenting the thought process during data exploration and initial model development phases.

# Typical Contents:

*   **Jupyter Notebook files (`.ipynb` files)**:  Notebooks containing code for:
    *   Data exploration and visualization.
    *   Data cleaning and preprocessing experiments.
    *   Feature engineering trials.
    *   Initial model prototyping and experimentation.
    *   Documenting analysis and findings.

# Usage Guidelines:

*   Use notebooks for exploratory work, prototyping, and interactive analysis.
*   Keep notebooks focused on specific tasks or analysis steps.
*   Document your thought process, findings, and code within the notebooks using Markdown cells.
*   Notebooks in this folder are typically not meant for production code. Once a robust solution is developed in a notebook, refactor the core logic into reusable Python scripts (potentially placed in a `src/` directory or similar).
*   Consider numbering or naming notebooks in a logical sequence to reflect a workflow or analysis pipeline (e.g., `01_data_exploration.ipynb`, `02_feature_engineering.ipynb`).
*   Avoid committing large datasets or output files directly within the `notebooks/` folder if possible (instead, point to data in the `data/` folder).
